## Build Instructions ##

The [gradle build system](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide) will fetch all dependencies and generate
files you need to build the project. You first need to generate the
local.properties (replace YOUR_SDK_DIR by your actual android sdk dir)
file:

    $ echo "sdk.dir=YOUR_SDK_DIR" > local.properties

You can now sync, build and install the project:

    $ ./gradlew assembleDebug # assemble the debug .apk
    $ ./gradlew installDebug  # install the debug .apk if you have an
                              # emulator or an Android device connected

You can use [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) by importing the project as a Gradle project.

* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
